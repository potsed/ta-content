The Product Owner is accountable for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/). How this is done may vary widely across organisations, [Scrum Teams](/guides/scrum/team/), and individuals.

The Product Owner is also accountable for effective [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl) management, which includes:

- Developing and explicitly communicating the [Product Goal](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl#commitment-product-goal);
- Creating and clearly communicating [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl) items;
- Ordering [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl) items; and,
- Ensuring that the [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl) is transparent, visible and understood.

The Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others. Regardless, the Product Owner remains accountable.

For Product Owners to succeed, the entire organisation must respect their decisions. These decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl), and through the inspectable Increment at the Sprint Review.

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the needs of many [stakeholders](/guides/scrum/stakeholders) in the [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl). Those wanting to change the [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl) can do so by trying to convince the Product Owner.
