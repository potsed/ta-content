A Scrum Team in Agile project management is composed of three key roles: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team. Each of these roles has its own set of tasks and responsibilities.

Product Owner (PO):

Product Backlog Management: The PO is responsible for managing the product backlog. This involves

- clearly expressing backlog items,
- ordering them to best achieve goals and missions,
- ensuring the value of the work the development team performs, and
- ensuring that the backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all.

Optimization of the value of the work: The PO ensures that the Development Team is working on tasks that create the most business value. The PO has a good understanding of the market, the customers, and the business, which they use to make sure that the most valuable functionality is being developed.

Stakeholder Management: The PO is the main point of contact for all stakeholders, including clients, executives, and the development team. They communicate the wishes of the stakeholders to the team and manage expectations.

Product Vision: The PO is responsible for defining and communicating the product vision to the team and making sure that everyone is working towards it.

Scrum Master (SM):

Scrum Framework Enforcement: The Scrum Master ensures that the Scrum principles and rules are followed by the team. They coach the team on Scrum and help them to improve their Scrum practices.

Blocker Removal: The Scrum Master is responsible for removing any impediments that are blocking the team from doing their work. This could be anything from helping to resolve conflicts within the team to coordinating with other teams or departments to remove external blockers.

Facilitation: The Scrum Master facilitates all of the Scrum ceremonies (Daily Scrum, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective). They make sure these meetings are effective and efficient.

Team Health and Morale: The Scrum Master focuses on maintaining the health and morale of the team. They work to build a trusting and safe environment where problems can be raised and resolved.

Development Team:

Delivery of a Potentially Shippable Product Increment: At the end of each sprint, the Development Team is responsible for delivering a "Done", useable, and potentially releasable product Increment. "Done" means that the increment is thoroughly tested, documented, and ready to be handed over to the customer or user.

Self-Organization: The Development Team organizes itself and its work. The team has autonomy over how to meet the Sprint Goal.

Cross-Functionality: The Development Team includes all the skills necessary to create a product Increment. The team works together on all tasks.

Sprint Backlog Management: The Development Team is responsible for managing the Sprint Backlog. This includes breaking down Product Backlog items into smaller, manageable tasks, estimating the effort required for these tasks, and tracking their progress throughout the Sprint.

All roles must collaborate and coordinate their work on a daily basis throughout the Sprint, for instance during the Daily Scrum meeting. They also need to inspect and adapt their work during the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective. This way, they continually improve their work and adapt the Product Backlog for future Sprints.
