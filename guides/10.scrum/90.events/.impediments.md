# What is an impediment?

Should the Scrum Master be the person who resolves blockers?

An impediment is to the scrum team what a faulty radiator is to a road trip whereas a wait in a queue for service is always a possibility
and therefore should be taken into account as part of the journey. A scrum Master can do very little to speed up the queue, but can find ways to fix the leaky radiator.

If you can perceive a challenge ahead of time, it is not an impediment - rather it is something that could have and should have been planned for.
