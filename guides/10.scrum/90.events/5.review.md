The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/) presents the results of their work to key [stakeholders](/guides/scrum/stakeholders) and progress toward the [Product Goal](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl#commitment-product-goal) is discussed.

During the event, the [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/) and [stakeholders](/guides/scrum/stakeholders) review what was accomplished in the Sprint and what has changed in their environment. Based on this information, attendees collaborate on what to do next. The [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl) may also be adjusted to meet new opportunities. The Sprint Review is a working session and the [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/) should avoid limiting it to a presentation.

The Sprint Review is the second to last event of the Sprint and is [timeboxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month Sprint](../timeboxes). For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
