The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

The [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/) inspects how the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions, processes, tools, and their [Definition of Done](/guides/scrum/artifacts/increment). Inspected elements often vary with the domain of work. Assumptions that led them astray are identified and their origins explored. The [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/) discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.

The [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/) identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible. They may even be added to the [Sprint Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/sbl) for the next Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. It is [timeboxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint](../timeboxes). For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.
