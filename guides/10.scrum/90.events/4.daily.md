The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the [Sprint Goal](/guides/scrum/artifacts/sbl#commitment-sprint-goal) and adapt the [Sprint Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/sbl) as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

The Daily Scrum is a [15-minute event](../timeboxes) for the [Developers](/guides/scrum/team/developers) of the [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/). To reduce complexity, it is held at the same time and place every working day of the Sprint. If the [Product Owner](/guides/scrum/team/po) or [Scrum Master](/guides/scrum/team/po) are actively working on items in the [Sprint Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/sbl), they participate as [Developers](/guides/scrum/team/developers).

The [Developers](/guides/scrum/team/developers) can select whatever structure and techniques they want, as long as their Daily Scrum focuses on progress toward the [Sprint Goal](/guides/scrum/artifacts/sbl#commitment-sprint-goal) and produces an actionable plan for the next day of work. This creates focus and improves self-management.

Daily Scrums improve communications, identify impediments, promote quick decision-making, and consequently eliminate the need for other meetings.

The Daily Scrum is not the only time [Developers](/guides/scrum/team/developers) are allowed to adjust their plan. They often meet throughout the day for more detailed discussions about adapting or re-planning the rest of the Sprintâ€™s work.
