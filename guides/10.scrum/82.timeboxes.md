Timeboxes are defined for each [event in Scrum](./events) including [the Sprint](./events/sprint) which is the collection of all the other events. They are designed to provide just enough time to meet all outcomes associated with completing [the Sprint](./events/sprint). In other words, theoretically there should be little to no need for other meetings relating to the [commitment of the scrum team to deliver the Sprint Goal during a sprint](./artifacts/sbl) producing the [increment](./artifacts/increment). Logically, this does not exclude the need for ongoing collaboration about the [increment](./artifacts/increment) within the [Scrum Team](./team) or with [Key Stakeholders](./stakeholders).

## Time Utilisation

Typically the combined timeboxes take up ~20% which of course leaves ~80%<sup>[(1)](#footnotes)</sup> for the developers to concentrate on delivering the current [Sprint Goal](./sprint_goal) as well as other tasks that might crop up - for example BAU or fixing issues. It also frees up time for the Product Owner to carry out their own accountabilities. All timeboxes, with the exception of the [Daily Scrum](./events/daily), are relative to the sprint length - that is they expand up to the maximum time for a one month sprint but can shorten in line with shorter sprints.

### Footnotes

1. Percentages of time can fluctuate based on the length of a working day - for example if you work a 7 hour day the timeboxes will take a higher percentage of time within a sprint than those who work a 9 hour day. The Scrum timeboxes collectively and coincidentally align with the [Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle).
