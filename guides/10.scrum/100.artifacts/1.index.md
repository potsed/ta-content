Scrumâ€™s artifacts represent work or value. They are designed to maximize transparency of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaptation.

Each artifact contains a commitment to ensure it provides information that enhances transparency and focus against which progress can be measured:

- For the [Product Backlog](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl) it is the [Product Goal](/guides/scrum/artifacts/pbl#commitment-product-goal).
- For the [Sprint](/guides/scrum/artifacts/sbl) it is the [Sprint Goal](/guides/scrum/artifacts/sbl#commitment-sprint-goal)].
- For the Increment it is the [Definition of Done](/guides/scrum/artifacts/increment).

These commitments exist to reinforce empiricism and the Scrum values for the [Scrum Team](/guides/scrum/team/) and their [stakeholders](/guides/scrum/stakeholders).
