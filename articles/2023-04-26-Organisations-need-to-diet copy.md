Organizations need to go on a diet. They have become slow, bloated, lethargic, and worse of all - not clear headed.

This is an opinion piece based on the authors own experience and observations.

They snack on long recognised unhealthy snacks of outdated processes all day, every day. Watching competitor moves like a bad reality TV show and reacting accordingly.

Many are so tied up in "doing things right" that they don't end up doing anything innovative.

Pragmatism is used as an excuse for stagnation - we might hurt ourselves if we don't make sure our exercise plan is not completely tailored exactly as we want it to be - instead of just getting up and going for a walk or run.

Outside consultants are called in to tell us exactly what many in our organisational body already know and try to voice on a daily basis. You should not be eating those potato chips - wow, amazing! Why didn't we think of that? But hey, let's be pragmatic - we must do it right!

Using your thumb on the remote to change channels - does not mean you made progress toward your health goals! Neither does switching one process out for another equally mundane process.

## To get healthy means you must make sacrifice

So now teams, managers, leaders, organizations please ask yourselves, do I really need to ask for that new report or add that new process? - If I do, what am I willing to give up? What is a healthier alternative?

Instead of adding more to the bloat of the organization, find ways to remove it! Please.

Do not just add new or change existing processes - find ways to remove them! Remove the red tape, remove the over the top governance, remove the bloat and the bureaucracy.

Go on a diet!
