Welcome to the captivating world of Scrum, where product development is an engaging adventure! Today, let's familiarize ourselves with two critical roles in this journey â€“ Stakeholders and Key Stakeholders.

## Stakeholders: The Silent Guardians

Stakeholders are individuals deeply invested in the product's success, but they are not directly part of the Scrum Team. Their role might not be elaborated in the Scrum Guide, but their importance is consistently highlighted throughout the narrative.

Stakeholders are encouraged to be on standby when the Scrum Team seeks their insights, helping to navigate product development and mitigate potential risks.

### Responsibilities of Stakeholders

- They negotiate any new work on the product directly with the Product Owner.
- They collaborate with the Product Owner to establish the value of a task.
- They provide timely responses and insights to the Scrum Team when requested.
- They maintain open and transparent communication with the Scrum Team about the work and its challenges.

## Key Stakeholders: The Trusted Counsel

Key Stakeholders are a select subset of stakeholders who shoulder extra responsibilities, particularly during Sprint Reviews. They possess specialized knowledge, expertise, or insights that enable them to review the work done during the Sprint and suggest further adjustments.

### Responsibilities of Key Stakeholders

- They review progress towards the product goal with the Scrum Team.
- They provide honest feedback and propose further improvements.

Although these roles may appear complex, they all share a common goal: supporting the product's journey from concept to reality. So here's a toast to Stakeholders and Key Stakeholders - the unsung heroes of Scrum!
