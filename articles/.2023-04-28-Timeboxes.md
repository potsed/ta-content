One thing many teams and organizations do routinely is to shorten the time-boxes of Scrum Events. The question that raises for myself is - why then are the timeboxes defined as they are in the Scrum Guide?

If one takes Sprint Planning as an example, the guide suggests a maximum of 8 hours per month which works out to ~2 hours per week. Now I've observed Scrum Teams attempt close planning out in 15 minutes or less for 2 week sprints which is 225 minutes shorter than the guideline.

Sure, by stating the maximum, the guide does not disuade shortening the timebox - but still the question remains, why then does the guide suggest the timeboxes it does?

### The Timebox Guidelines for Scrum Events

| Event | Per Month | Per Week |
|:---|:---|:---|
| The Sprint | Up to 1 month |
| Sprint Planning | 8 hours | 2 hours |
| Sprint Review | 4 hours | 1 hour |
| Sprint Retrospective | 3 hours | 45 minutes |
| Daily Scrum | 5 hours | 75 minutes |
