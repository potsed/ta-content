Trust is a fundamental aspect of any successful relationship, be it personal or professional. At its core, trust is made up of two key components: being trustworthy and trusting. In this blog post, we will explore each of these components in more detail, including their definitions and characteristics.

## Being Trustworthy

Being trustworthy is the quality of being dependable, reliable, and honest. A trustworthy individual is someone who can be counted on to fulfill commitments and obligations, and who takes responsibility for their actions and decisions. In order to be trustworthy, individuals must exhibit consistency and reliability in their actions and decision-making, be honest and transparent in communication, and be accountable for their actions and decisions. Trustworthy individuals value integrity and ethics in all aspects of life and build and maintain trust through consistent and responsible behaviour.

## Trusting

Trusting is the act of placing confidence and belief in someone or something, often without explicit evidence or proof. Trusting individuals are willing to rely on the integrity, abilities, or judgement of others, and are often willing to take risks in pursuit of shared success. In order to trust, individuals must be open and honest in communication, willing to rely on the integrity, abilities, or judgement of others, and confident in the abilities of others to contribute to shared goals. Trusting individuals value transparency and collaboration in working relationships and recognize the importance of trust in effective teamwork and agile development.

Together, being trustworthy and trusting form the foundation of trust, which is essential to effective teamwork and agile development. By cultivating these qualities within yourself and your team members, you can build a culture of trust that fosters openness, transparency, and collaboration, and achieves long-term success and sustainability in your initiatives.

At the heart of any successful organisation is the importance of building a culture of trust within the team. By embracing and embodying the qualities of being trustworthy and trusting, you can create an environment that is conducive to agile development and effective teamwork.
