In this article I'll explain how one Scrum Master (Disclaimer: That would be `me` :grin:) goes about improving sprint planning but before that let's go over some of the anti-patterns of sprint planning and why even though they appear good ideas on the surface they will erode the rest of the sprint.

### Anti-Pattern: Pre-ordained Sprint Backlogs

Very few things are worse than when scrum team enters a sprint planning event to be presented with a pre-ordained list of todo items. Look, I get the arguments for this practice such as `Saving time` or `all we're going to do is move them across anyway` or `[insert other arguments here]` - it does not matter, this is a terrible practice that ultimately ends up costing far more than it supposedly saves.

1. Giving intelligent professional people a list of chores is insulting at best.
2. Ownership by the team for the commitment is lost.
3. Having a list of items is not the same as having an achievable plan.

### Anti-pattern: 15 minute quickies

### Anti-pattern: Refinement planning
