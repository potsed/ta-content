title: Sprint Captains
---

In the spirit of having [each other's backs](../ground_rules), a single developer should take on the responsibility of attending external meetings, running any developer meetings like the [daily scrum](/guides/scrum/events/daily), and generally handling interruptions that could interfere with the developers achieving the [committed Sprint Goal](/guides/scrum/sprint_goal).

The Sprint Captain effectively takes a productivity hit so that the rest of the team can concentrate on delivering the [Sprint Goal](/guides/scrum/sprint_goal). Of course this does not mean excluding the Sprint Captain from the work being done, but rather that they may not be able to put in as much effort toward delivering it.

The Sprint Captain will keep other developers on their team informed of any important and/or relevant information.

With 5 developers on a team, this arrangement means that over 5 sprints each developer would get to do productive and enjoyable development work for 4 sprints and then one sprint supporting and relieving other developers in the team.
