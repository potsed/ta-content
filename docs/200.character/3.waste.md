title: Removing Waste
---

In the world of agile development, complexity can be a major obstacle to achieving our goals. It can slow us down, create confusion, and increase the risk of failure. That's why, at our organisation, we believe in keeping things simple and breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.

## Simplifying Organisational Structure and Workflows

This philosophy applies not only to the way we develop products, but also to the way we organise our teams and our processes. By simplifying our organisational structure and streamlining our workflows, we can remove waste and prevent confusion, allowing us to work more efficiently and effectively.

## Embracing Simplicity

Of course, simplicity is not always easy to achieve. It requires a deep understanding of our processes and our goals, as well as a willingness to constantly evaluate and improve our approach. It also requires strong leadership, with managers who are willing to embrace simplicity and foster a culture of continuous improvement.

## The Rewards of Simplicity

But the rewards of simplicity are clear. By breaking down complex problems into smaller steps, we can achieve our goals more quickly and with fewer errors. We can also increase collaboration and communication within our teams, creating a more cohesive and productive work environment.

So if you're looking to improve agility within your organisation, start by embracing the power of simplicity. By removing waste and preventing confusion, you can create a more efficient and effective workflow, and achieve greater success in your agile initiatives.
