In this section, we will explore each of these components in more detail, including their definitions and characteristics.

## Being Trustworthy

- Dependability and reliability in relationships
- Valuing integrity and ethics in all aspects of life

## Trusting

Trusting is the act of placing confidence and belief in someone or something, often without explicit evidence or proof. Trusting individuals are willing to rely on the integrity, abilities, or judgement of others, and are often willing to take risks in pursuit of shared success. Characteristics of trusting include:

- Openness and honesty in communication
- Willingness to rely on the integrity, abilities, or judgement of others
- Confidence in the abilities of others to contribute to shared goals
- Willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of shared success
- Willingness to be vulnerable and share information

Together, being trustworthy and trusting form the foundation of trust, which is essential to effective teamwork and agile development. By cultivating these qualities within yourself and your team members, you can build a culture of trust that fosters openness, transparency, and collaboration, and achieves long-term success and sustainability in your agile initiatives.
