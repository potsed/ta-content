title: Assist each other
---

In TAGOS, we believe that fostering a culture of collaboration and experimentation is essential to achieving success in agile development. Collaboration requires team members to help each other out, even if it means trying something new or stepping outside their comfort zone. By supporting each other and being open to new ideas, we can achieve more together than we ever could alone.

## Helping Each Other Out

We encourage team members to help each other out and be willing to take on new challenges. By doing so, we create a culture of learning and growth where team members can expand their skill sets and take on new roles. When team members help each other, they build trust, respect, and a sense of shared purpose.

## Making Each Other's Jobs Easier

At TAGOS, we believe that every team member has a role to play in supporting the success of the organisation. We encourage team members to always be on the lookout for ways to make each other's jobs a little easier. This might mean sharing knowledge, skills, or tools, or simply being willing to lend a helping hand when needed. By supporting each other in this way, we can create a more productive, efficient, and collaborative work environment.

## Removing Obstacles to Agility

Complexity can be a major obstacle to agility. To remove waste and prevent confusion, we believe in keeping things simple and breaking complex problems down into smaller, more manageable steps. This applies not only to the way we develop products, but also to the way our organisations are organised.

### Keeping Things Simple

In TAGOS, we believe in keeping things simple to remove waste and prevent confusion. We break complex problems down into smaller, more manageable steps, and prioritize tasks based on their importance and impact. This helps us to stay focused, avoid unnecessary complexity, and move forward more quickly.

### Breaking Down Silos

Organisational silos can be a major obstacle to agility. They create barriers to communication, collaboration, and innovation, and prevent organisations from adapting quickly to changing market conditions. In TAGOS, we believe in breaking down silos by promoting cross-functional collaboration and teamwork. This helps to create a more cohesive and aligned organisation that can respond quickly and effectively to new challenges and opportunities.
