title: "Adopting TAGOS"
project: TAGOS

Adoption of TAGOS is effectively taking on a system of relentless and radical change while still being compassionate toward humanity.

One of the benefits of being open source is that we don't have to pull any punches. We do not need to keep a sales pipeline safe so to speak. So we can be really open about what you're getting yourself into as you undertake a so-called agile or digital transformation.

The reality is, a transformation indicates a radical departure from what has come before. So called "Dual Operating Systems" or other excuses to not go all in tend to create hybrid, mismatched systems that generate organisational confusion where reporting lines, directions, clarity, trust, and more are eroded. Bureaucracy and agility do not mix well! Sure compromise and flexibility are important except when those compromises undermine the very character of the organisation or worse, leave the organisation in a compromised position.

Some organisations are simply not suited to do what it takes to become agile - and that's ok, stay safe. For others, it's time to stop hot-footing around the topic, agile is not the framework - it is one part of the very essence or organisational character of.

Imagine for a moment standing at the top of a mountain - it is the mountain you have painstakingly climbed. There is a path and everyone in your company is following that path. Agile is like installing the cable car. The path becomes less important to maintain as more parts of the business start to use the cable car. If however some departments don't change to use the cable car, then everyone relying on those departments will face long delays as people continue climb the paths. You either have to continue using the path and accept the difficulties that entails, fixing the path as it needs it or you have to embrace the new technology and leave the path behind - being between the two is not the way to be efficient. And yet this is exactly what people are doing.

To put it bluntly, true agile transformation likely involves radically changing the "safe" or to some degree "pragmatic" path up the mountain and being willing to radically change the entire system to a cable car. That can entail disolving some long standing departments - do you still need those old walking sticks? It requires changing how things are financed and delivered - are delivery still waiting for financial approval to walk up the path before they can start? It could even drive shrinkage to become more lean - do you need as many people walking up the path to deliver messages when they can simply be sent in the cable car? All of these things can have very big impacts on morale and other areas.

It can also mean having to let go of long held beliefs about how to organize things like financing, legal, sales, marketing, engineering, pmo and even the executive office. It means having to learn new ways of reporting and learning new skills.

The bottom line is - the organisation has to be prepared to rethink every aspect of how the business functions - or risk the worse position of sitting somewhere on the fence neither making progress nor being efficient.
