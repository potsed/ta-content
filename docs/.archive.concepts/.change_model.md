The Change Effectiveness Model is a model for making significant organisational structural changes. Unlike [Prosci ADKAR](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar), [Kotter's 8 step method](https://www.kotterinc.com/methodology/8-steps/) or similar change facilitation models, which we encourage the use of, this model highlights which organization conceptual layer is best targeted for significant change.

### Why do we need this?

Quite simply, when organizations need to employ a broad change - like when doing a business transformation - many start off by identifying gaps and arranging training. Now training is certainly important, but it is not as effective in applying the change as one might think.

Additionally, when implementing any significant change, we often hear people talk about "Mindset" - Training may have some effect on mindset - but broadly, it is rarely as effective as we hope leaving us lamenting the broken implementations of changes we want to make.

It is apparent to us that something else is needed, so we went looking. What we found was a Model called the Logical Levels of change - which was a little left field we admit - but it gave us a basis for explaining how we might effect change for conceptual levels of the organization.

### The Model

Each layer of this model would have a higher ROI. For example, simply changing a process without updating skills will cause problems, however if one updates the skills first then it is more likely to have an effect on the process.
