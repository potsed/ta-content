With outcome driven agility, we [celebrate achieving those outcomes](/GridOS/concepts/accomplishments) rather than the process. This means that the desired outcomes need to be broken down enough to keep the teams motivated and performant.

We value this as N. Historically items valued N have ranged in delivery time from X - Z weeks of total effort. Therefore, we can theoretically place this change to take between X and Z weeks to deliver.

## No more velocity

## No more estimates

## Improved accuracy

Given our current progress on Inventory Item A is at 4 weeks out of 20, we estimate the delivery of this item in J weeks of effort

Therefore we estimate this will take between X - Z weeks of effort to get done once we get started. Our current WIP has Approximately A - B time left, so we should get started on Improving Medication Search Times in 3-4week time given what we know currently.
