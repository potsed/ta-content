Your size matters. If you try to apply a framework designed for organizations of greater than ten teams into an organization of less than ten teams - then it stands to reason there will be unnecessary and possibly redundant processes applied which can lead to increased levels of discontent among employees. Applying a framework designed for too small an organization can lead to similar results.

One might refer to the Goldilocks fable of too hot, too cold, just right. What is the just right framework for your current organization.

I've experienced this myself, in one organization where the discontent of the employees was leading to high attrition rates. One of the contributing factors was the companies insistence of applying a framework designed for more than 10 teams on a single product into the organization which had several distinct products by most accounts with 3 or less teams.

By adopting the principles of a framework designed for the size of the product areas, we were able to arrest the flow of people leaving the organization and create genuine progress.
