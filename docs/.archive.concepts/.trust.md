Trust is a cornerstone of agility - that is, to be trusting _and_ trustworthy. Trust goes beyond merely being honest with each other - it involves being reliable, collaborative, truthful, generous, gracious, non-judgemental, accepting and more.

Imagine the best team of people you have ever seen in action. With that team in mind, do/did you think those team members trust each other with their livelihoods?

In [High Performing Teams](/GridOS/concepts/high_performance), each member of the team has some influence on the livelihood of the other members of the team. Why, because in a team, everyone's efforts are as important as each others toward achieving the desired outcomes for the entire cohort. If a team continuously performs inadequately it becomes inevitable that changes in the form of layoffs and/or an injection of new members is made in an effort to increase the teams effectiveness. So it can be said that a teammate has influence over the livelihoods of other teammates including themselves. For that reason alone, we could make the argument that it is imperative to build trust in teams.

### Trusting

Trusting people is tough, let's face it we've all been let down or had out trust eroded in some form or another - and likely more than once.
