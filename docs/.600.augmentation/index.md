---

With machine intelligence (MI) (comprised of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)) and the increasing number of automation processes available, finding the right balance between human intelligence (HI) and MI is going to be critical. One area MI does well at is problem solving. HI has an upper hand in conceptualization. This is where augmentation fits in how can we augment HI with MI?
